All classes in this folder can be easily replaced with code generation when unity supports roslyn code gens.
Until then this is a working solution, we place one runtime GetValue call per port once on initialization.

Some technical notes:

Connections use reflection binding to bind ValuePort<>s to a real value field.
In order to create this connection we need to access the field once, then cache it.

Replacement:
Instead of reflection, we can directly inject the field via Roslyn CG removing the need for both reflection
data at all, and the runtime initialization step. Note that this class will probably be necessary in the 
editor, and the CG solution is likely only a minor runtime optimization.
